        <span class="spantag">There's a lady who's sure </span>
        <span class="spantag">All that glitters is gold </span>
        <span class="spantag">And she's buying a stairway to Heaven </span>
        <span class="spantag">When she gets there she knows </span>
        <span class="spantag">If the stores are all closed </span>
        <span class="spantag">With a word she can get what she came for </span>
        <span class="spantag"
          >Oh oh oh oh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">There's a sign on the wall </span>
        <span class="spantag">But she wants to be sure </span>
        <span class="spantag"
          >'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
        </span>
        <span class="spantag">In a tree by the brook </span>
        <span class="spantag">There's a songbird who sings </span>
        <span class="spantag"
          >Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">Ooh, it makes me wonder </span>
        <span class="spantag">Ooh, it makes me wonder </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">There's a feeling I get </span>
        <span class="spantag">When I look to the west </span>
        <span class="spantag">And my spirit is crying for leaving </span>
        <span class="spantag">In my thoughts I have seen </span>
        <span class="spantag">Rings of smoke through the trees </span>
        <span class="spantag"
          >And the voices of those who standing looking
        </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">Ooh, it makes me wonder </span>
        <span class="spantag">Ooh, it really makes me wonder </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag"
          >And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
        </span>
        <span class="spantag">Then the piper will lead us to reason </span>
        <span class="spantag"> And a new day will dawn </span>
        <span class="spantag">For those who stand long </span>
        <span class="spantag">And the forests will echo with laughter </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">If there's a bustle in your hedgerow </span>
        <span class="spantag">Don't be alarmed now </span>
        <span class="spantag">It's just a spring clean for the May queen </span>
        <span class="spantag">Yes, there are two paths you can go by </span>
        <span class="spantag">But in the long run </span>
        <span class="spantag"
          >There's still time to change the road you're on
        </span>
        <span class="spantag">And it makes me wonder </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">Your head is humming and it won't go </span>
        <span class="spantag">In case you don't know </span>
        <span class="spantag">The piper's calling you to join him </span>
        <span class="spantag">Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? </span>
        <span class="spantag">And did you know </span>
        <span class="spantag">Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? </span>
        <br />
        <span class="spantag">And as we wind on down the road </span>
        <span class="spantag">Our shadows taller than our soul </span>
        <span class="spantag">There walks a lady we all know </span>
        <span class="spantag">Who shines white light and wants to show </span>
        <span class="spantag">How everything still turns to gold </span>
        <span class="spantag">And if you listen very hard </span>
        <span class="spantag">The tune will come to you at last </span>
        <span class="spantag">When all are one and one is all </span>
        <span class="spantag">To be a rock and not to roll </span>
        <span class="spantag">And she's buying a stairway to Heaven </span>
